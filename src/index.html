                <h3>I"m Noah Allen, a <b>software engineer</b> who learns quickly, programs skillfully, and loves building products that matter. I enjoy the challenge of coding, but I also appreciate how thoughtful software design can help us live better lives.</h3>
                <h3>Designing software in a way that helps people is an important challenge. If a product is designed poorly, users become frustrated. But if it is designed well, people are delighted to use it.</h3>
                <h3>My work has taught me that this neverending focus on user experience is the core of creating a successful product.</h3>
