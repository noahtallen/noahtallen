            <h3>At Zonder, I was the <b>CTO</b> and <b>lead developer</b> for the project. We have added several members to the team since I joined, and I now manage a team of 3 developers.</h3>
            <h3>I learned a lot of valuable skills during this project, including how to prioritize, how to develop with growth in mind, and what to do about dev ops.</h3>
            <h3>A key practice for Zonder was making sure developers could easily release features. As a result, I implemented <b>continuous deployment</b> for our mobile app and supporting internal websites.</h3>
            <h3>I also implemented cost-saving measures that aren't important for smaller apps - for instance, better paging and performance across lists of data. Additionally, creating diff logic for big data updates of game content helped reduce database system useage.</h3>
            <h3>The most important aspect of a startup is making sure that each team member is excited about the proejct. It's important to create an environment where employees want to take the initiative to make the product better, especially when there aren't managers looking over their shoulders.</h3>
